# build-a-web-app

## Purpose:
**Sunday July 21, 2019**
The purpose of this project is to build a web-based application from start to finish.

I will document my progress with a blog that I will design and build myself. Initially, everything will run on my local machine; however, I hope to deploy at a later date.

My goal is to let this overarching project as well as its components evolve as I learn new concepts, ideas, and technologies. Perhaps start by building a basic Javascript CRUD application, but being open to transitioning it to one that uses a modern framework, or even a different language, if it seems like a better use case.
